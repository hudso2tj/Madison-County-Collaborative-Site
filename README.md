# Instructions
To run this program there are a few things that are necessary to its operation.
1. Visual Studio (or another development application)
2. Database (we used Microsoft SQL Server)

Once you have those downloaded follow these steps to get the application working and open:
1. Copy and paste the entirety of each of the .txt files in the "SQL-Code" into a query on your database management system and execute
2. If no errors occur, you may open the .sln file on Visual Studio
3. Once there run the program and you'll be greeted with a home page
4. Navigate to the "Login" button
5. The username and password for admin priviledges is:
   Username: admin
   Password: password
6. You're all set to explore all the features the system has to offer!
